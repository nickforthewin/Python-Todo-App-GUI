# Tasks App

## Installation

### Running with python (Windows)

1. Have python 3.5 or 3.6 installed

2. Create a virtual environment with the command:

```powershell
python -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual by entering the commands below

Powershell:

```powershell
venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
```

Windows command prompt:

```console
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

4. (Assuming you have the virtual environment activated for the rest of the tutorial) install PyQt5 and FBS using the command below

```powershell
pip install PyQt5 fbs
```

5. Run the app using FBS using the following command

```powershell
fbs run
```

### Using the downloadable application (Windows only)

You can download our windows application from our [releases page](https://github.com/nickforthewin/Python-Todo-App-GUI/releases). However, this is not as stable as running it with python.
